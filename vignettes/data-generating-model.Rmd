With this package, we employ the latent variable approach to generating goal attainment scaling [@Kiresuk1968] data that was introduced by [@Urach2019].
Here, we walk through some of the theory behind this model and show how it translates to the various R functions, but highly recommend any users to read the paper themselves to better understand the model.

First, we introduce some notation.
The observed goal score for subject $i$'s goal $j$ is denoted $x_{ij}$, and comes from the discretization
